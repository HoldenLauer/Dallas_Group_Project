# Dallas_Group_Project

## Communication Protocols
As a group, we will communicate primarily through zoom and slack. All team members are committed to sharing updates asynchronously through slack and meeting via zoom when we need to work together.

## Topic
For our project, we will be using images to train a classification model to determine which sport is being shown in the image. We selected this topic because as a group we are interested in working with images for our machine learning project. 

We are using a data set from kaggle. Our data source contains training images, test images, and a csv containing the sport correlated to each image. 

## Questions
Which sport is portrayed in the input image? 
How accurately can our model predict the sport in the image?
